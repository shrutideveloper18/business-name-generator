# Business Name Generator 🚀

This is my **first JavaScript project**, built as part of my frontend learning journey.

The Business Name Generator helps users generate creative business names based on the selected business type. It combines adjectives, business categories, and suffixes using JavaScript logic and displays the result directly on the webpage.
